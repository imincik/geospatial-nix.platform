# Geospatial NIX Platform

The main objective of the “Geospatial NIX Platform” project is to build a platform for practical hands-on education with a focus on geospatial technologies at high school and university levels. The purpose of this platform is to run isolated and reproducible environments created for each project or exercise by Geospatial NIX/Geospatial NIX.today (https://geospatial-nix.today/, https://imincik.github.io/geospatial-nix.env/) by a teacher or a student. This would allow users to build a library of self-contained (software, environment configuration, data, workflows) classes which can be easily used by a teacher in a school lab or at home by a student.
